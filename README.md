# Fuji
<img src="https://github.com/SakuraWald/fuji-fabric/raw/1.20.2/src/main/resources/assets/fuji/icon.png" width="128" alt="mod icon">

Fuji is a minecraft mod that provides many essential and useful modules for vanilla survival.

> **_If minecraft gets updated, you can mail sakurawald@gmail.com for fuji update reminder._**

> This is a **server-side only** mod, but you can use it in a **single-player world**. (Yes, the single-player world also includes a logic-server)
> - For a server-maintainer: You only need to install this mod at the server-side, and the players don't need to install this mod at their client-side
> - For a player: You only need to install this mod at the client-side, and then you can use the modules in your single-player world.

# Feature
1. **Vanilla-Respect**: all the modules do the least change to the vanilla game (Never touch the game-logic).
2. **Fully-Modular**: you can disable any module completely if you don't like it (The commands and events will all be disabled, just like the code never exists, without any performance issue).
3. **High-Performance**: all the codes are optimized for performance, and the modules are designed to be as lightweight as
   possible (From data-structure, algorithm, lazy-load and cache to improve performance greatly).
4. **Easy-to-Use**: all the modules are designed to be easy to use, and the commands are designed to be easy to remember, even the language file is designed to be easy to understand.

# Modules

_**By default, all the modules are disabled, and this mod does nothing to the vanilla minecraft.**_

<img src="https://github.com/SakuraWald/fuji-fabric/raw/1.20.2/.github/images/death-log.gif" alt="module presentation gif">

#### WorldDownloaderModule
provides /download command for every player who wants to download the nearby chunks around him. (Including rate-limit and attack-protection. This command is safe to use, because everytime the command will copy the original-region-file into a temp-file, and only send the temp-file, which does nothing to the original-region-file)
<img src="https://github.com/SakuraWald/fuji-fabric/raw/1.20.2/.github/images/download.gif" alt="module presentation gif">

#### MainStatsModule
This module sums up some basic stats, like: total_playtime, total_mined, total_placed, total_killed and total_moved (We call these 5 stats `MainStats`). You can use these placeholders in ChatStyleModule and MOTDModule

#### HeadModule
provides /head command to buy player heads.

#### ProfilerModule
provides /profiler to sample the server health. (Including os, vm, cpu, ram, tps, mspt and gc)

#### ZeroCommandPermissionModule
this module modifies ALL commands (even the command is registered from other mods) and adds a prefix-permission (we called it zero-permission) for the command. If the player has zero-permission, then we check zero-permission for that command, otherwise check the command's original requires-permission. 

> Tips: if you don't know how to determine command-node name, you can just type `/lp>  group default permission zero.` and let luckperms tell you what command-node names you can use.
> - Allow the default group to use a command by adding a zero-permission (e.g. /seed) -> `/lp  group default permission set zero.seed true`
> - Disallow the default group to use a command by adding a zero-permission (e.g. /help) -> `/lp  group default permission set zero.help false`
> - Disallow the default group to use a sub-command from a command by adding a zero-permission (e.g. /player [player] mount) -> `/lp group default permission set zero.player.player.mount false`

#### BypassThingsModule
provides options to bypass some annoyed things.

- bypass-chat-rate-limit -> avoid "Kicked for spamming"
- bypass-move-speed-limit -> avoid "Moved too quickly!"
- bypass-max-player-limit -> avoid server max-player limit

#### OpProtectModule
auto deop an op-player when he leaves the server.

#### MultiObsidianPlatformModule
makes every EnderPortal generate its own Obsidian Platform (Up to 128 in survival-mode, you can even use creative-mode to build more Ender Portal and more ObsidianPlatform. Please note that: all the obsidian-platform are vanilla-respect, which means they have the SAME chunk-layout and the SAME behaviour as vanilla obsidian-platform which locates in (100,50,0))
<img src="https://github.com/SakuraWald/fuji-fabric/raw/1.20.2/.github/images/multi-obsidian-platform.gif" alt="module presentation gif">

#### StrongerPlayerListModule
a fix patch for ServerWorld#PlayerList, to avoid CME in player-list (e.g. sometimes tick-entity and tick-block-entity will randomly crash the server because of player-list CME)

#### WhitelistFixModule
for offline whitelist, this makes whitelist ONLY compare the username and ignore UUID!

#### CommandSpyModule
log command issue into the console.

# Config

### What is the format of config files?
To make the config files more `readable` and `transparent`, we use `.json` as the config file format.
We try our best to avoid the usage of `.dat` format
(The vanilla minecraft data file format which needs an NBTExplorer to view and edit).

### Where are the config files?
All the config files are inside `config/fuji/` directory so
that you don't need to find out where the config files are.

### How to update to a newer version?
Normally, the newer version will generate missing configuration keys automatically, but if this doesn't work, you can delete the old config file and restart the server to let the newer version generate the default config file.

# Permission
This mod uses a low-level permission system, which means that most of the admin commands are required level-permission to use. However, if you really want a command-permission-node for every command, you can use the `zero-command-permission` module (This module adds a prefix command-permission for ALL commands, even the command is not provided by this mod!).

> In other words, most of the commands doesn't require any permission to use, but if you want, you can use `ZeroPermissionModule` to add a prefix-permission for every command!

# Optimization
For a better server performance and without vanilla sacrifice, we recommend you to use `Lithium` and `Krypton` with this mod.

For JVM, we recommended GraalVM, which performs better than OpenJDK.
> Here are the JVM arguments we optimized for GraalVM (Reference from papermc and graalvm manual):
> 
> java -Xms16G -Xmx16G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:G1NewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M -XX:G1ReservePercent=15 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -XX:+UseLargePages -XX:+UseTransparentHugePages -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading -Djava.io.tmpdir=/tmp -jar server.jar --nogui

# Diagnosis
By default, this mod will output its `debug messages` into `logs/debug.log` so that you can know what this mod is doing.
You can add `-Dfuji.level="INFO"` to change the logger level.

# FAQ
###  What is `cron expression`?

Cron expression is an easy and powerful language used to define when a job should be triggered.
You can learn more and generate a cron expression from the generator: https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html

### This mod failed to mixin the server at server-startup stage, what should I do?

This mod need `fabric-api` mod to work, so make sure you have installed `fabric-api` mod.

Before you enable `BetterFakePlayerModule` and `BetterInfoModule` , you need to install `carpet` mod.

Before you enable `ProfilerMoudle`, you need to install `spark` mod.

### How can I report bugs or suggest new features?

You can create an issue at the project's `github` page.
